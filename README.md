# FunWithGans

In learning the mathematical concepts of Generative Adversarial Networks, I decided to use a dataset of images of Pokemon that I found on Kaggle!
The self contained notebook, "pokemon_generator.ipynb," is the result of my learning so far. Please check it out using the nbviewer link found below, and be nice, I'm still learning the 
foundations of GANs!
